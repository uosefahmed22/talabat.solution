## Project Overview

**eCommerce** is an open-source (test scenario) software designed to create an easy and simple "Shop" API. It consists of two microservices:

1. **Products API:** Manages everything related to stock and products, including adding, listing, editing, deleting, and updating products.

2. **Purchase API:** Handles everything related to orders and carts, such as creating, viewing, removing, adding items, removing items, and checking out.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.

2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage
